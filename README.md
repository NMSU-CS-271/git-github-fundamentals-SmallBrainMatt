I learned more about repositories, pull requests, and about how good github is for when it comes to programming whether you are programming by your self or in a group.

What I want to know is how often are we going to be using all of the features of github which really what im asking is how often if ever are we going to be working in groups.

Other than that I will say github doesn't seem like something I can learn that quickly because it offers a lot of features but overall im very excited to be using this and im looking forward to what we'll be doing with it.
